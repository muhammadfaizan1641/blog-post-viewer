# Blog Post Viewer â€“ React Project

This is a simple React application that displays a list of blog posts. Users can search through the posts and view or hide their full content using buttons. The app is built using core React concepts like components, props, and hooks.

## Features

- Component-based structure using `App`, `PostList`, and `Post` components.
- Real-time search functionality: Search posts by title or content.
- Each blog post has a toggle button to show or hide its full content.
- React hooks like `useState` are used for managing state (search input and post visibility).
- Clean and minimal styling using inline CSS.

## File Structure

- `App.js`: Main component that holds the blog post data and handles the search logic.
- `PostList.js`: Receives filtered posts and maps over them to render each post.
- `Post.js`: Displays a single post with a button to toggle visibility of content.
